There was a person who was very old but wise. He isn't part of this story though. There was also the most powerful witch who ever lived. She is kind of part of this story. Maybe a few lines.
There was also a knight, and he was the hero,
of another story.
This story is about two rabbits, Jack and Jill.
It is also mainly about he two main characters, Jerry and Jacky.Those were carrots.
Jerry and Jack started running around and playing in the garden with their best friend a toy witch(same witch from before).
Soon two rabbits descended on their playground and started chasing them.
They called the witch for help, but of course the witch is a toy. 
The rabbits ran fatser than the carrots and eventually caught up.
They gobbled the carrots in one gulp. This is the destiny of every carrot living near rabbits.
But this was not the destiny of hose carrots.
Their destiny was to be eaten in a few days by a human.
So they managed to jump out of the rabbits' mouths and run away.
This was only due to their destiny.
So all carrots at home. Well, don't try this at home.
